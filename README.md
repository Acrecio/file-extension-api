## install for devs

npm run start -s

## explorer

The explorer load the SQLite database to your browser, parse it thanks to SQL.js allowing you to query the database directly from your web browser. This is done thanks to a port of [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/about.html) to Webassembly, by compiling the SQLite C code.
